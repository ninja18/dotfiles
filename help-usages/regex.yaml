digit match : \d (anywhere in a line)  \D (not digit match)
wildcard ( that can match any char): . (to use actual . use \.)
Specific char (to match): [chars to match] put it inside [] (only individual chars are matched not whole word inside [])
exclude specific char : [^chars to exclude] use ^ inside []
char ranges (to specify range of sequential chars) : [0-6a-zA-Z] (use - operator) (only inside [])
alphanumeric short form : \w (= [A-Za-z0-9_]) \W (= [^A-Za-z0-9])
repetitive chars match : char{num } or [chars]{num of repetition} (some have ranges {min,max}) (can use with metachars as well)
zero and more or one and more : char* or [chars]* zero or more, char+ or [chars]+ one or more
optional char match : char? or [chars]? to optionally match if it is present
whitespaces : \t \n  \s (for all whitespaces) \S (non-whitespace chars)  
start and end of line : $ for end of line, ^ for start of line (this is different from ^ used inside [] for excluding) 
Capturing groups : (group to capture) (use (chars) along with matching patterns before and after that) (Capture groups is the only way to make use of *,+,? on groups rather than individual chars)
Nested groups : (group(sub)) (info comes from left to right paranthesis group)
Conditional : (word1 | word2) ( | is or here ) (to match any of two word group)
boundary of word and non-word char : \b (matches boundary of word char to non-word) ( \w+\b to match a word)
Referencing captured groups : \0 \1 \2 for full matched text, group 1 , group 2 respectively (this can be used like to swap two numbers in search and replace (\d+)-(\d+) and replace \2-\1.



often best practice to write as specific regular expressions as possible to ensure that
we don't get false positives when matching against real world text.

Global command tricks:
  :g/^$/ d - delete all empty lines in a file

  :g/^$/,/./-j - reduce multiple blank lines to a single blank
  
  :10,20g/^/ mo 10 - reverse the order of the lines starting from the line 10 up to the line 20.
